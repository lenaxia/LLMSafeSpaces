# COORDINATE.md — Multi-Agent Work Coordination

This file is the source of truth for what work is in-flight across all agents.
**Before starting any work: read this file. After finishing any work: update this file and commit it.**

Rules:
- Claim a section before touching its files. If it's claimed by another agent, wait or pick different work.
- Keep claims specific (file paths, not vague areas).
- Mark work DONE immediately when finished — do not batch updates.
- If you abandon work, release the claim so another agent can pick it up.
- Always git pull before starting work. Always commit COORDINATE.md with your work commits.
- To queue behind a current claim, add a row to **Pending Claims**. When the blocking claim is released, move your row to Active Claims.
